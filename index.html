      <p>
        Our mission is to help people give meaning to their lives. By
        consciously thinking for one week about your life, we hope that you will
        discover your goal in your life. You can sometimes walk around with an
        unconscious need for meaning. This can be expressed in a sense of
        meaninglessness. You can find a short-term satisfaction in money, sex,
        drugs, music and sound, but sooner or later you discover that these are
        all temporary and do not offer lasting satisfaction. We want you to
        discover there is more to life and that there is a great destination
        waiting for you! Do you want to learn more? It is all free and does not
        require you to do anything
